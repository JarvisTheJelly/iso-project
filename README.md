Simple game using isometric graphics. Don't really know where this is planning on going yet.

Just had an urge to make a game with an isometric blocky feel (inspired by Bastion perhaps).

I don't have a plan for any sort of gameplay, just more of a test to see how this works and what I can do with it.
